    <h1>Learn How to Code</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the coding course!</p>
    <p>
        This is a beginner-friendly guide to help you learn how to code step by
        step designed by ChatGPT. This course is designed to introduce you to the world of coding. We will start
        with HTML, then move on to CSS, JavaScript, and finally hosting your own web app. At first my mission was to
        learn myself and that's what I've done! This web page was coded by myself while learning from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy this journey like I did!</p>
    <p>Greetings, Luna</p>

        <summary class="section-title"> Week 1: Understand HTML </summary>
        <p>Welcome to the first week of your coding journey! This week, we will focus on understanding the basics of
            HTML â”€just like tags and its structure. Firstly, we are going to build the app's skeleton.</p>
        <h4>Flashcards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://example.com/flashcard1">Paragraph tag</a></li>
            Element/Concept Name: &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; (Paragraph)
            <p>Purpose: Used to define a paragraph of text.
            <p>Syntax:
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>Example in context:
            <pre><code>
                &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;My First Page&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is an example paragraph below the heading.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
            </code></pre>
            Notes:
            <p>- Browsers automatically add spacing before and after a &lt;p&gt;.
            <p>- Do NOT put other block elements (like
                &lt;div&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;) inside a &lt;p&gt;.
            <p>- If you need to add a line break within a paragraph, use the &lt;br&gt; tag.

                <li><a href="https://example.com/flashcard2">Flashcard 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://example.com/flashcard3">Flashcard 3</a></li>
        </ul>
